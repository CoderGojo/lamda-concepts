# Course Overview

This course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of Java's functional programming features, focusing on lambdas, functional interfaces, and method references. Each module delves into key concepts and practical applications, enabling participants to harness the power of these features in real-world scenarios.

## Modules

### 1. Understanding Lambdas
This module introduces the concept of lambda expressions in Java. You will learn what lambdas are, how they work, and the benefits they bring to Java programming. Key topics include:
- Syntax of lambda expressions
- Using lambdas to simplify code
- Differences between lambdas and anonymous inner classes

### 2. Using Lambdas
In this module, you will explore various ways to use lambda expressions in Java. Practical examples will demonstrate how lambdas can make your code more concise and readable. Topics covered include:
- Implementing functional interfaces with lambdas
- Using lambdas in collection operations
- Common use cases for lambdas

### 3. Functional Interfaces
This module dives into functional interfaces, which are key to understanding and using lambdas effectively. You will learn about:
- The definition and role of functional interfaces
- Common functional interfaces in the `java.util.function` package
- Creating custom functional interfaces

### 4. Method References
Method references are a shorthand notation for lambda expressions. In this module, you will learn how to use method references to make your code more concise and expressive. Key topics include:
- Types of method references (static, instance, constructor)
- Converting lambdas to method references
- Practical examples of method references in Java

### 5. Collection References
This module covers how to utilize lambdas and method references with Java collections. You will explore:
- Using lambdas with collections' `forEach`, `map`, and `filter` methods
- Sorting and transforming collections using lambdas and method references
- Real-world examples of collection manipulation with lambdas

## Conclusion
By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of how to effectively use lambdas, functional interfaces, and method references in your Java programming. This knowledge will help you write cleaner, more efficient code and take full advantage of Java's functional programming capabilities.
